  "body": "## Cloud education for Middle and Secondary School\r\nThis is a fun interactive presentation I created for a conference to introduce Cloud and Big Data concepts to Middle and Secondary School students. The presentations are developed in Flash and are gamified appropriately for student ages.\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\nThese presentations can be accessed from Laptops, Computers or Tablets thus making it highly accessible to the tech-savvy children of today. Included are a total of 4 presentations – two for each age group. One for cloud computing and another for Big Data. These presentations present the children with animated explanation of basic concepts of Cloud and Big Data. And also contains interactive scenarios where the learner interacts with the characters in the presentation to understand the concept better. At the end each chapter presents an experiment through which the learner gets exposure to the real-time cloud applications. Each presentation also provides basic information regarding EMC’s contribution to the technology and how EMC products help resolve the challenges in these fields of computing. \r\n\r\n### Primary School - Cloud Introduction \r\nIntroduces cloud to the students through a scenario of two friends sharing movie files. Then explains the various concepts of cloud computing and EMC's cloud offerings. \r\nExperiments: \r\n1. Install free cloud storage application on computers and demo access anywhere feature of cloud \r\n2. Create account for the students on online paint application (queeky.com) to demonstrate SAAS. \r\n\r\n![SWF Presentation](https://github.com/mmumshad/Cloud-Education/blob/master/Cloud%20-%20Primary%20School.swf)\r\n\r\n### Secondary School - Cloud Introduction \r\nIn addition to the above, explains cloud concepts to students using a web hosting scenario and the advantages of cloud in it. \r\nExperiments: \r\n1. Create a free/temporary account on Amazon web services(or similar) to demo IAAS feature of cloud so students could host their own web site for free. \r\n2. Visualizing Western Expansion - Students analyze the divergent paths of the American people in the West from 1800 to the mid-1800s and the challenges they faced, using Google's cloud-based fusion tables. \r\n\r\n### Primary School - Big Data Introduction \r\nIntroduces BigData concepts to children through animated slides - generators of big data and what we do with big data, big data challenges and EMC's solutions, batch processing algorithms and map-reduce algorithms explained in very simple way. \r\nExperiments: \r\n1. Storage space calculation excersise - Students calculate the amount of storage required for a site like facebook. \r\n2. Analyze the results of a class of students using tally sheets and idenitfy the subjects needed for improvement. Then show how big data accomplishes this for all students in a school, state or country. \r\n3. Conduct a spelling bee contest, identify the wrong spellings and their patterns. Then prove how Google uses Big Data to predict correct spellings during search. \r\n\r\n### Secondary School - Big Data Introduction \r\nIn Addition to the above explains EMC's Big Data Logos so they could explain to their parents what the pictures mean the next time they see an EMC Bus with Big data Ad on it.  Advanced implementations of Big Data are also included.\r\nExperiments: \r\n1. Open space analysis of a City Map - Calculate the total area of open space in a city using the interactive presentation slide. Understand the effort for doing the same for a whole country and how Big Data makes it possible through Massice Parallel Processing \r\n2. Class activity - Mapper Reducer excercise to understand Map-Reduce Algorithm- Designate students as Mappers and Reducers to count the total occurances of words using Map-Reduce Algorithm. \r\n\r\n### Sources: \r\nEMC's Human Face of Big Data \r\nEMC's Big Data Brochure \r\nEMC's Digital Universe \r\nGoogles Computation Thinking",
